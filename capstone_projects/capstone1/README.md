# Capstone Project 1 - Building an Expected Goals Model From Shot-Event Data

By Jayanth Nair

The aim of this capstone project is to develop an expected goals model from soccer shots data. Expected goals or xG is essentially the probability of a shot to result in a goal.

# Data
The dataset used for this project is the [Statsbomb Women's Soccer Open Data](https://github.com/j-v-n/open-data). Only the events data from this dataset is used in this project. Events data describes all the events that occurred in a match. The specific events of interest in this project are shots and any key passes prior to shots.

# Notebooks
The notebooks in this repository are, in order of the project flow from data wrangling to model application are:
  - data_wrangling.ipynb
  - data_storytelling.ipynb
  - statistical_inference.ipynb
  - predictive_model_selection.ipynb
  - model_application.ipynb
